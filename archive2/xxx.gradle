// See: http://andresalmiray.com/newsletter/issue001/  expalins about project properties
// 1. value of cn in local gradle.properties is Saw  like: foo = local or cn = Saw  quotes not needed
// 2. if cn is found in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties then it is used
// 3. if commandline option -Pcn=Wrench that overrides 1 & 2
// 4. but when this script has ext.cn = 'Screws' it overrides 1,2,3
// ext.cn = 'Screws' prints Screws
// cn = 'Screws' also treated as project.ext property so prints Screws
// def cn = 'Screws' also treated as script variable property so prints Screws
// but comment out the above and gradle -b xxx.gradle -Pcn=Hammer  will print Hammer

println '--- starting ---'
println cn

//ext.foo = 'build'
//println foo
