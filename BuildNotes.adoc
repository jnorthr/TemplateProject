# TemplateProject

Travis Build Status for Master Branch: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jnorthr/TemplateProject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jnorthr/TemplateProject)

A Gradle project for users who develop with Git, GitHub, Travis, Gradle and Groovy/Java/Scala . Clone includes gradle build tool wrapper and folder structure like maven/gradle so you don't need an installed gradle build tool.
 
Pre-requisites

1. Working internet connection
2. Installed Git client to copy/clone this repo
3. Ability to use terminal console
4. If no **projectname** value then pick ../$projectDir root folder name as it
5. Merge tasks from copyDocs into copyCore
6. Improve README
7. Write bash script to build project

Steps  
1. Open terminal console

1. Change directory \( cd \) into target folder location

2. Run this command to create a folder named GParsGroovyTests and copy down all the pieces :

   [git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/TemplateProject.git](git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/TemplateProject.git)

3. **cd TemplateProject /**

4. **./gradlew** runs a series of defined tasks to build and test code samples

5. After prior step completes, examine ** TemplateProject /** folder to find the **/build/** folder with test results

Note: **.travis.yml** needed extra logic to be able to push to github repo and have Travis C/I testing work as expected.
